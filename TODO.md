# TODO

- [ ] Create acceptance tests that just iterate over a bunch of test cases. Each case has an input Dhall file and an output text file where calling dhall-to-json or dhall-to-yaml on the input should yield the expected result
- [ ] Simplify all the weirdness around keys. I should just copy & paste the list of actions instead of going through all this trouble
- [ ] Add CI that runs tests with Github
- [ ] Looks for more opportunities to drastically simplify stuff
